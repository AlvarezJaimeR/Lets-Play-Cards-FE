✴Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card wins the round. 

✴ If the card is the same value... each player will turn up the next card. If the turned-up cards are the same value again then each player will again turn up the next card. The player with the higher card value wins that round and receives a bonus score for each previous tie.
